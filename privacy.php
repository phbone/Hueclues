                Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect information in relation to our web site, and your choices about the collection and use of your information.

                	Our Policy applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service ("Users").

                INFORMATION WE COLLECT
                We collect the following types of information.
                Information you provide us directly:

                	Communications between you and Hueclues. For example, we may send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). Note that you may not opt out of Service-related e-mails.
                Cookies and similar technologies:
                	When you visit the Service, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, and local storage to collect information about how you use Hueclues and provide features to you.
                	We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to your devices, which may use cookies or similar technologies placed by us.
                Log file information:
                	Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you make a request to access (i.e., visit) a web page or app. It can also be provided when the content of the webpage or app is downloaded to your browser.
                	When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information, including your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. We may also collect similar information from emails sent to our Users which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.

                HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
                In addition to some of the specific uses of information we describe in this Privacy Policy, we may use information that we receive to:
                	help you efficiently access your information after you sign in
                	remember information so you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service;
                	provide personalized content and information to you and others, which could include online ads or other forms of marketing
                	provide, improve, test, and monitor the effectiveness of our Service
                	develop and test new products and features
                	monitor metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns
                	diagnose or fix technology problems

                SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
                We will not rent or sell your information to third parties outside Hueclues without your consent, except as noted in this Policy.
                Parties with whom we may share your information:
                	We may share your information as well as information from tools like cookies, and log files, with third-party organizations that help us provide the Service to you ("Service Providers"). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary to provide the Service under reasonable confidentiality terms.
                	We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information would allow third-party ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
                	We may remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with other parties. We may also combine your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you and share that aggregated information.
                What happens in the event of a change of control:
                	If we sell or otherwise transfer part or the whole of Hueclues or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation), your information such as name and email address, User Content and any other information collected through the Service may be among the items sold or transferred. You will continue to own your User Content. The buyer or transferee will have to honor the commitments we have made in this Privacy Policy.
                Responding to legal requests and preventing harm:
                	We may access, preserve and share your information in response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Canada where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; and to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. Information we receive about you may be accessed, processed and retained for an extended period of time when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations concerning possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm.

                HOW WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION
                Storage and Processing:

                	Hueclues, its Affiliates, or Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from Canadian law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

                	Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to emails between you and Hueclues, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to Hueclues make to their services.
