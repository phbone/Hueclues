                General Conditions

                <br/>1.

                We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service or your access to the Service
                for any reason, without notice, at any time, and without liability to you. If we terminate your
                access to the Service, your photos and all other data will no longer be accessible through your
                account (e.g., you will not be able to navigate to your username and view your photos), but those
                materials and data may persist and appear within the Service. Upon termination, all licenses and
                other rights granted to you in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.

                <br/>2.

                We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated
                Terms") from time to time. Unless we make a change for legal or administrative reasons, we
                will provide advance notice before the Updated Terms become effective. You agree that we may
                notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service
                after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may
                specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these
                Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the Service. The Updated Terms will be
                effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms,
                and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern
                any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.

                <br/>3.   We reserve the right to force forfeiture of any username for any reason.

                <br/>4.
                We reserve the right to refuse access to the Service to anyone for any reason at any

             

                <br/>5.

                We may, but have no obligation to, remove, edit, block, and/or monitor Content or
                accounts containing Content that we determine in our sole discretion violates these Terms of
                Use.

                <br/>6.

                You agree that Hueclues is not responsible or liable for the conduct of any user. Exercise
                common sense and your best judgment when you submit or post Content or any personal or
                other information.

                <br/>7.

                There may be links from the Service, or from communications you receive from
                the Service, to third-party web sites or features. There may also be links to third-party web sites
                or features in images or comments within the Service. The Service also includes third-party
                content that we do not control, maintain or endorse. Functionality on the Service may also permit
                interactions between the Service and a third-party web site or feature, including applications that
                connect the Service or your profile on the Service with a third-party web site or feature. For
                example, the Service may include a feature that enables you to share Content from the Service

                or your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party's service or
                application. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-
                party service and you do so at your own risk. Hueclues does not control any of these third-party
                web services or any of their content. You expressly acknowledge and agree that Hueclues is in
                no way responsible or liable for any such third-party services or features. YOUR
                CORRESPONDENCE AND BUSINESS DEALINGS WITH THIRD PARTIES FOUND THROUGH
                THE SERVICE ARE SOLELY BETWEEN YOU AND THE THIRD PARTY. You may choose, at
                your sole and absolute discretion and risk, to use applications that connect the Service or your
                profile on the Service with a third-party service (each, an "Application") and such Application may
                interact with, connect to or gather and/or pull information from and to your Service profile. By
                using such Applications, you acknowledge and agree to the following: (i) if you use an Application
                to share information, you are consenting to information about your profile on the Service being
                shared; (ii) your use of an Application may cause personally identifying information to be publicly
                disclosed and/or associated with you, even if Hueclues has not itself provided such information;
                and (iii) your use of an Application is at your own option and risk, and you will hold the Hueclues
                Parties (defined below) harmless for activity related to the Application.

                You agree that you are responsible for all data charges you incur through use of the
                Service.

                <br/>8.

                <br/>9.

                We prohibit crawling, scraping, caching or otherwise accessing any content on the
                Service via automated means, including but not limited to, user profiles and photos (except as
                may be the result of standard search engine protocols or technologies used by a search engine
                with Hueclues’ expressed consent).

                Rights

                Hueclues does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the
                Service. Instead, you hereby grant to Hueclues a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free,
                transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the
                Service, subject to the Service's Privacy Policy.

                <br/>1.

                Hueclues may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that
                Hueclues may place such advertising and promotions on the Service or on, about, or in
                conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions
                are subject to change without specific notice to you.

                <br/>2.

                <br/>3.

                You acknowledge that we may not always identify paid services, sponsored content, or
                commercial communications as such.

                <br/>4.

                You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through
                the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms
                of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate,
                misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy
                rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you
                agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on
                or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of

                Use in your jurisdiction.

                The Service contains content owned or licensed by Hueclues ("Hueclues Content").
                Hueclues Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and,
                as between you and Hueclues, Hueclues owns and retains all rights in the Hueclues Content and
                the Service. You will not remove, alter or conceal any copyright, trademark, service mark or other
                proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Hueclues Content and you will not
                reproduce, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works based on, perform, display, publish, distribute,
                transmit, broadcast, sell, license or otherwise exploit the Hueclues Content.

                <br/>5.

                The Hueclues name and logo are trademarks of Hueclues, and may not be copied,
                imitated or used, in whole or in part, without the prior written permission of Hueclues. In addition,
                all page headers, custom graphics, button icons and scripts are service marks, trademarks and/
                or trade dress of Hueclues, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without
                prior written permission from Hueclues.

                <br/>6.

                <br/>7.

                Although it is Hueclues’ intention for the Service to be available as much as
                possible, there will be occasions when the Service may be interrupted, including, without
                limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of
                telecommunications links and/or equipment. Also, Hueclues reserves the right to remove any
                Content from the Service for any reason, without prior notice. Content removed from the Service
                may continue to be stored by Hueclues, including, without limitation, in order to comply with
                certain legal obligations, but may not be retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently,
                Hueclues encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. Hueclues will not be
                liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services, or the loss of
                any Content. You also acknowledge that the Internet may be subject to breaches of security and
                that the submission of Content or other information may not be secure.

                <br/>8.

                You agree that Hueclues is not responsible for, and does not endorse, Content posted
                within the Service. Hueclues does not have any obligation to prescreen, monitor, edit, or remove
                any Content. If your Content violates these Terms of Use, you may bear legal responsibility for
                that Content.

                <br/>9.

                You acknowledge and agree that your relationship with Hueclues is not a confidential,
                fiduciary, or other type of special relationship, and that your decision to submit any Content does
                not place Hueclues in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the
                general public, including with regard to your Content. None of your Content will be subject to any
                obligation of confidence on the part of Hueclues, and Hueclues will not be liable for any use or
                disclosure of any Content you provide.

                <br/>10.

                It is Hueclues’ policy not to accept or consider content, information, ideas, suggestions
                or other materials other than those we have specifically requested and to which certain specific
                terms, conditions and requirements may apply. This is to avoid any misunderstandings if your
                ideas are similar to those we have developed or are developing independently. Accordingly,
                Hueclues does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas, and takes no responsibility for
                any materials or ideas so transmitted. If, despite our policy, you choose to send us content,
                information, ideas, suggestions, or other materials, you further agree that Hueclues is free to
                use any such content, information, ideas, suggestions or other materials, for any purposes
                whatsoever, including, without limitation, developing and marketing products and services,
                without any liability or payment of any kind to you.

                SERVICE'S OPERATION; OR (H) ANY DAMAGE TO ANY USER'S COMPUTER, MOBILE
                DEVICE, OR OTHER EQUIPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                DAMAGE FROM ANY SECURITY BREACH OR FROM ANY VIRUS, BUGS, TAMPERING,
                FRAUD, ERROR, OMISSION, INTERRUPTION, DEFECT, DELAY IN OPERATION OR
                TRANSMISSION, COMPUTER LINE OR NETWORK FAILURE OR ANY OTHER TECHNICAL
                OR OTHER MALFUNCTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST
                PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF
                RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE OR
                EVEN IF THE HUECLUES PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
                OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
                NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
                WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY NEGLIGENCE, ACTS OF GOD,
                TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURE, OR THEFT OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SERVICE). IN
                NO EVENT WILL THE HUECLUES PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE FOR
                LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DEATH OR PERSONAL
                INJURY. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL
                OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT
                APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL THE HUECLUES PARTIES TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU
                FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OR ACTION EXCEED ONE HUNDRED

                CANADIAN DOLLARS ($100.00).

                YOU AGREE THAT IN THE EVENT YOU INCUR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES OR INJURIES
                THAT ARISE OUT OF HUECLUES’ ACTS OR OMISSIONS, THE DAMAGES, IF ANY, CAUSED
                TO YOU ARE NOT IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION
                PREVENTING ANY EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE, SERVICE, PROPERTY, PRODUCT
                OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY THE HUECLUES PARTIES, AND YOU
                WILL HAVE NO RIGHTS TO ENJOIN OR RESTRAIN THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,
                DISTRIBUTION, ADVERTISING, EXHIBITION OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEB SITE,
                PROPERTY, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR OTHER CONTENT OWNED OR CONTROLLED BY
                THE HUECLUES PARTIES.

                HUECLUES IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS, CONTENT, INFORMATION,
                OR DATA OF THIRD PARTIES, AND YOU RELEASE US, OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
                EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS FROM ANY CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN,

                ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST
                ANY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

                Indemnification

                You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the Service) agree
                to defend (at Hueclues’ request), indemnify and hold the Hueclues Parties harmless from and
                against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation,
                reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the
                following (including as a result of your direct activities on the Service or those conducted on your
                behalf): (i) your Content or your access to or use of the Service; (ii) your breach or alleged breach
                of these Terms of Use; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation, any
                intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; (iv) your violation
                of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and
                quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and
                legislative authorities; or (v) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully
                required by Hueclues in the defense of any claim. Hueclues reserves the right to assume the
                exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in
                any event settle any claim without the prior written consent of Hueclues.

                Arbitration

                Except if you opt-out or for disputes relating to: (1) your or Hueclues’ intellectual property (such
                as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents); or (2)
                violations of provisions 13 or 15 of the Basic Terms, above ("Excluded Disputes"), you agree
                that all disputes between you and Hueclues (whether or not such dispute involves a third party)
                with regard to your relationship with Hueclues, including without limitation disputes related to
                these Terms of Use, your use of the Service, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be
                resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the Canadian Arbitration Association's rules for

                arbitration of consumer-related disputes and you and Hueclues hereby expressly waive trial by
                jury. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by
                that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor
                Hueclues will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this
                agreement. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or
                representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person's account, if Hueclues
                is a party to the proceeding. In the event the Canadian Arbitration Association is unwilling or
                unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either
                Hueclues or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration
                and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any
                court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator
                will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of
                Use.

                You may opt out of this agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Huecluescan require
                the other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Hueclues in
                writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this arbitration provision.

                You must include your name and residence address, the email address you use for your
                Hueclues account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement.

                If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties
                contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this
                Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of
                your relationship with Hueclues.

                Time Limitation on Claims

                You agree that any claim you may have arising out of or related to your relationship with
                Hueclues must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, your claim is
                permanently barred.

                Governing Law & Venue

                These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the province
                of Ontario, Canada. For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these
                Terms of Use, the Excluded Disputes or if you opt out of the agreement to arbitrate, you agree to
                resolve any dispute you have with Hueclues exclusively in a provincial or federal court located in
                Toronto, Ontario.

                If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason
                unenforceable during arbitration or by a court of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will
                be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability
                of any remaining provisions. Hueclues reserves the right to change this dispute resolution
                provision, but any such changes will not apply to disputes arising before the effective date of the

                amendment. This dispute resolution provision will survive the termination of any or all of your
                transactions with Hueclues.

                Entire Agreement

                If you are using the Service on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to
                enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire
                agreement between you and Hueclues and governs your use of the Service, superseding any
                prior agreements between you and Hueclues. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign
                any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by
                operation of law, without the prior written consent of Hueclues. Any purported assignment or
                delegation by you without the appropriate prior written consent of Hueclues will be null and
                void. Hueclues may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent.
                If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid

                or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed
                severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the
                remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and
                effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the
                Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

                Territorial Restrictions

                The information provided within the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any
                person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary
                to law or regulation or which would subject Hueclues to any registration requirement within such
                jurisdiction or country. We reserve the right to limit the availability of the Service or any portion of
                the Service, to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion,
                and to limit the quantities of any content, program, product, service or other feature that Hueclues
                provides.

                Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to Canadian export controls.
                Thus, no software from the Service may be downloaded, exported or re-exported: (a) into (or to
                a national or resident of) any country to which Canada has embargoed goods; or (b) to anyone
                on the Canadian Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the Canadian
                Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders. By downloading any software related to the
                Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national
                or resident of, any such country or on any such list.

                The effective date of these Terms of Use is February 12, 20<br/>13. These Terms of Use were written
                in English (CA). To the extent any translated version of these Terms of Use conflicts with the
                English version, the English version controls.
